The number of started projects and/or empty checkboxes in my to do list is getting out of hand. I have:

- \> 7 hobby tech projects in a state where I need to put ”just a bit” more effort to them to get them to the finish line,
- 2 or 3 hobby tech projects that have an incalculable number of man-hours left, and
- a nebulous cloud of non-tech stuff that should be done (and preferably prioritized).

Starting is easy (and fun), finishing is hard (and dull). Despite having internalized this, it is very tempting to step into the trap willingly and start another one.

### And now?

I’ll make the conscious effort to finish incomplete work before starting new projects. I’m going to be a lot stricter in the scoping of my DIY software: things that are supposed to be small should be very small indeed. No extra features.
