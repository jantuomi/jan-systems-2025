## Lightning talk

<p data-unfold-hidden>
I recently presented a lightning talk about the IndieWeb and personal websites to my colleagues at the office. Even though I don't normally enjoy presenting, speaking about things I'm passionate about always turns out to be rather easy. The talk and the presentation that I used to support the talk were well received.

## Tinkering

<p data-unfold-hidden>
Later, when I shared my PowerPoint slides in the IndieWeb chat, I was asked if I had considered using HTML slides instead of pptx. The thought had crossed my mind, but I didn’t have time to put the thought into practice before my talk. It was a curious idea though.

So curious in fact, that I decided to study up on the ”HTML slideshow landscape”: what kind of tools there are, how do they work on a static site, things like that. Turns out that a tool called `reveal.js` is very popular and often recommended.  An idea entered my mind: what if I could turn an HTML note (like this one that you’re reading) into an HTML slideshow, in a somewhat automated fashion?

## Literate slideshow

- A portmanteau of _literate program_ and _slideshow_
- Convert a semantically marked up post to a slideshow with a click
- This post is a literate slideshow

## Direction

I don't know if I'll even need this project. Maybe I'll use it in some posts in the future?
