## TV & anime

**Started**

- Chiikawa. The episodes are so short that we watch a bunch at a time.

**Finished**

- Dandadan S2
- The Witcher, seasons S2–S4
- Golden Boy
- Yuru Camp S1

## Games

- Stray
- Pizza Tower

## Music

- Stopped using Spotify. I already pay for Youtube Premium + Music so I already have a streaming service that I can use. I also try to be more mindful of my music consumption and focus on supporting independent artists and creators. Mostly by buying digital albums or tapes from Bandcamp or distributors.
- Saw [Merzbow](https://merzbow.net/show/) live.

## This website

The new Zola-based implementation has been working well. There was a bunch of figuring-out to do at first, like how to structure the templates to get the [/now](/now) page working, or how to get the previous/next post links appended to each post, but it's been worth it. Zola compilation is way faster than my earlier custom Scheme-based SSG.

My earlier system had the major upside that it directly read Markdown from my Obsidian vault, which allowed me to edit posts on the go. Currently everything's laptop-driven, which is bit of a pain. I might set up something with file shares to allow editing posts from my phone. Deployments will still happen from the laptop.
