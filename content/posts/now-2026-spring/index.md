## Music

- Stopped using Spotify. I already pay for Youtube Premium + Music so I already have a streaming service that I can use. I also try to be more mindful of my music consumption and focus on supporting independent artists and creators. Mostly by buying digital albums or tapes from Bandcamp or distributors.
- Saw [Merzbow](https://merzbow.net/show/) live.

I listen to a bunch of black metal and adjacent genres. There's a lot of white supremacists and fascists in those communities, especially in the Finnish scene (sadly). I figured I should use a couple of hours to go through some of the artists that I have listened to and see if they're sketchy or not.

I'm happy to find that most of the stuff I listen to is a-ok, and a great deal of artists are vocally against hate, or at least apolitical (whatever that means). However, some artists had slipped through the cracks.

**Mgła** collaborates with Nazis and the frontman has an earlier project with clearly anti-semitic titles and lyrics.
**Drudkh** is Ukrainian ultra-nationalist. They have an album dedicated to a fascist figure who was a Nazi collaborator, and they have used Nazi imagery during their live shows.

I really enjoyed their music in 2025, but I won't be supporting them anymore.

(**Agriculture** is radically left-wing, by the way)

## This website

The new Zola-based implementation has been working well. There was a bunch of figuring-out to do at first, like how to structure the templates to get the [/now](/now) page working, or how to get the previous/next post links appended to each post, but it's been worth it. Zola compilation is way faster than my earlier custom Scheme-based SSG.

My earlier system had the major upside that it directly read Markdown from my Obsidian vault, which allowed me to edit posts on the go. Currently everything's laptop-driven, which is bit of a pain. I might set up something with file shares to allow editing posts from my phone. Deployments will still happen from the laptop.
