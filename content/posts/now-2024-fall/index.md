## Home

- Dog dug up the yard and the new grass. Multiple times even. Planted some clovers to hide the bald spot. Fixed up a vine that fell down from the wall.
- Painted some rooms. The previous owner left them in a sorry state.
- Built a little bathroom shelf, a little nightstand and a sound diffuser. Getting the hang of woodworking.

## Relationship

- Got engaged!

## Quests

I remember seeing some blog post somewhere that advocated, possibly a bit ironically, the concept of using **main quests**, **side quests** and **daily quests** in tracking your to-dos. I decided to give them a try. I now use main and side quests to keep track of my higher level objectives. These objectives function at the week or month level. I do not use daily quests.

I’ve always found it hard to stick to to-do tracking schemes. They are often too complex and unable to track priorities or time spans in a way that would feel natural. Maybe this approach is simple and video-gamey enough to stick.
