## Home

- Yard work: some small landscaping, changed the topsoil to something less dry, and planted grass and flowers.
- Purchased a **wine fridge** for some reason. This led directly to...

## A new hobby

- Started learning about wines. Organized a wine tasting. My top pick: Domaine Laroche Chablis 1er Cru Les Vaudevey 2022.

### Career

- I passed the **AWS Certified Developer Associate** certificate exam! A celebratory espresso martini was in order. Planning to do **Solutions Architect Associate** next.

## Finished reading

- Finished _Category Theory for Programmers_ by Bartosz Milewski. Had to work through it twice, taking notes on the second pass. I wish I started taking notes from the get go.
- _Wine Simple_ by Aldo Sohm, wine fundamentals for beginners.
- Some CS papers:
  - _Do Be Do Be Do_ by Sam Lindley et al. The paper defines a language called Frank that uses a novel algebraic effects based typed effect system instead of monads. Also has types for suspended calculations (think Haskell thunks). Similar to Koka I believe.
  - _Cons should not eval its arguments_, a classic that paves the way for lazily evaluated languages.
- Japanese short stories (Yomu Yomu app) such as _人間椅子 (Human chair)_, a story about a carpenter that decides to live inside a chair that he’s made. Adapted to a vocabulary of 1500 words.

## Started reading

- _Designing Data-intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann.
