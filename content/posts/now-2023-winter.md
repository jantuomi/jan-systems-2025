## Currently

- Working on this site
- Doing small renovations and fixes to the house
- Learning Chicken Scheme and using it to build [desmoctl](/projects#desmoctl) and [this website](/posts/deploying-the-garden)
- Reading _Category Theory for Programmers_ by Bartosz Milewski

## Recently

- Purchased a 100 m2 terraced house
- Upstreamed some fixes to [Spliit](https://spliit.app/)
- Started a project of reading more books. I never read much growing up so this is something I have to learn to do. Lately I've been into learning about programming languages with "big ideas", i.e. Lisp (programs as data), Forth (stack focus), Smalltalk (OOP).
