**ATK16** is a learning project I've been working on for some time. It started off as a 16-bit, reduced instruction set computer (RISC) CPU design but evolved into an entire computer with peripherals and software.

Instead of repeating myself, I'm going to direct you to the [ATK16 project page](/projects/atk16). It's not complete by any means, but I've written a bunch about the project and my motivations already! [¹](#footnote)
