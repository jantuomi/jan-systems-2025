Hi! My name is Jan. I am a senior software engineer based in Finland. Welcome to my personal blog and digital garden.

I like keeping things simple and pragmatic. I'm a life-long learner, but I don't go chasing trends.

I enjoy spending time with my fiancée and our dog, tinkering with computer hardware and software, games of all kinds but mostly video-, tabletop and role-playing, electronics, music, language learning and linguistics.

I created this site as a creative outlet for expressing myself and sharing my experiences.

{% import "macros/latest_posts.html" as latest_posts %}
{{ latest_posts::latest_posts(limit=3) }}

The [archive](archive) page is a listing of my posts. I post sporadically about various subjects and with varying levels of effort.

The [linklog](linklog) page contains a curated aggregation of bookmarks, saved blog posts and essays, books, series, papers or anything else that I feel like sharing or recommending, stored in [Linkhut](https://ln.ht/~jant).

On the [now](now) page I write what's currently going on in my life. Stuff that some would write onto their social media page.

The [projects](projects) page contains info about my hobby projects.
