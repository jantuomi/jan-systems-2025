# My projects

### [ATK16](atk16/)

A 16-bit computer and ecosystem project with a custom ISA and toolchain.

### [🌐 BLEK](https://blekmusik.bandcamp.com/album/m-rkret-efter-soluppg-ngen)

A dungeon synth / dark ambient duo project with Juuso.

### [Cookbook](cookbook/)

An online cookbook of recipes I have prepared and enjoyed. Useful for me mostly.

### [🌐 desmoctl](https://github.com/jantuomi/desmoctl)

A CLI tool for communicating with a [Desmofylakas API](https://github.com/poksiala/desmo-api). A kind of a half-humorous attempt at creating something that is like a small Kubernetes but for BSD jails.

### [Diddle](diddle/)

A minimalist, performant, accessibility-focused Doodle alternative. See [post](/posts/diddle-event-scheduler).

### [Learning Japanese](learning-japanese/)

I have been self-studying Japanese on and off since I was 13.
