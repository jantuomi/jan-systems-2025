I have been self-studying Japanese on and off since I was 13. For the longest time my methods were very inefficient and my efforts didn't amount to much. I found [Wanikani](https://www.wanikani.com/) and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and spaced repetition some years later, but failed to set them up in a reasonable way, leading to me spending a lot of energy doing mostly useless reviews. Around 2020, after a frustration-induced pause I decided to re-evaluate my approach. I set up a proper Anki deck, acquired a number of "graded reader" books to read (see [Tadoku](https://tadoku.org/japanese/en/what-is-tadoku-en/)) and started listening to a lot of Japanese-only learner podcasts. This made my learning skyrocket.

In terms of proficiency I would self-assess my level to be around [JLPT N4-N3](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html). I know that self-assessment is kind of a meme, but still. I've yet to take an exam, but I'm planning to.

I'm currently taking an extended break from daily learning again because of time issues. However, I feel like starting again. I still read and watch Japanese content every now and then.

I feel like the thing I lose the fastest by taking a break is kanji reading ability.
